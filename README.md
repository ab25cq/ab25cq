HELLO

I'm interested in the user interface of UNIX terminals. At first I was making a console filer, but I fell in love with shells and made shells. After that, I thought that the interpreter of the original language had a better user interface than the shell, so I created the original language.

Using languages

C, C++

Using libraries

readline, pcre, ncurses, LLVM, libc

Using tools

gdb, valgrind, autoconf, make, shell script, ruby, qemu, clang, vim, tmux

My Software

I made an original language called clover2. A language that can also be used as a shell. I made a vi clone called vicl with clover2.

I created a C extension language called neo-c. I made a vi clone called wi with neo-c.

I created a C extension language called comelang. I made a vi clone called vin with comelang. I made a text processing interpreter called zed with comelang.

A long time ago I made a ruby-like shell called xyzsh.

A long time ago, I made a console filer called mfiler4.
